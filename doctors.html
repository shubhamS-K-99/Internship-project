					<h3>Doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
					<p>Doctors form an essential part of an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue they
						have a duty to participate in pandemic response due to their special skills, but these skills
						vary between different doctors, and their duties are constrained by other competing rights. We
						conclude that while doctors should be encouraged to meet the demand for medical aid in the
						pandemic, those who make the sacrifices and increased efforts are owed reciprocal obligations in
						return. When reciprocal obligations are not met, doctors are further justified in opting out of
						specific tasks, as long as this is proportionate to the unmet obligation.</p>

					<h3 style="color: black;">COVID-19 Pandemic in India</h3>
					<p>The <strong> First cases </strong> COVID-19 in India were reported on 30 January 2020 in three
						towns of Kerala, among three Indian medical students who had returned from Wuhan, the epicenter
						of the pandemic.Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23 March, and in the rest of the country
						on 25 March. By mid-May 2020, five cities accounted for around half of all reported cases in the
						country: Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Thane.On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded
						active cases for the first time. Infection rates started to drop in September, along with the
						number of new and active cases.Daily cases peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported
						per-day, dropping to below 15,000 in January 2021.
					</p>
					<p>
						A <strong> Second wave </strong> in March 2021 was much devastating than the first, with
						shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medicines in parts of the
						country.[16] By late April, India led the world in new and active cases. On 30 April 2021, it
						became the first country to report over 400,000 new cases in a 24-hour period. Experts stated
						that the virus may reach an endemic stage in India rather than completely disappear; in late
						August 2021, Soumya Swaminathan said India may be in some stage of endemicity where the country
						learns to live with the virus.

				<h2>THANK YOU COVID WARRIORS</h2>
				<p style="color: white;">Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting
					themselves off from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety
					and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end. Most importantly,
					we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get
					from us. Among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us, the biggest one
					is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient medical fraternity and give
					medical professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this
					crisis is over. Moreover, the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and
					technology. Nothing will be a greater tribute to the health-care workers than this.</p>
